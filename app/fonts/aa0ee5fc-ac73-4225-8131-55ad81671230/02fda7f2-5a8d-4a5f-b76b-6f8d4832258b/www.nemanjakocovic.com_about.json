I love building things that are not only functional, but also intuitive and a little bit delightful. Whether it’s a micro-interaction or a full experience, I believe good design is in the details.\n\nThis space is my way of sharing what I’ve learned, what I’m still figuring out, and hopefully giving something useful back to the community.\n\nIt’s all part of my way of staying curious, staying creative, and staying in motion.\n\n![Map of Serbia](https://static.wixstatic.com/media/e9e011_b26650aeef9a4cb8ab4e1d92e6828b63~mv2.png/v1/fill/w_628,h_829,al_c,q_90,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01,enc_avif,quality_auto/whereamiblackoutline.png)\n\nfrom a small place known\n\nas sjenica, located in serbia\n\nTHE PROCESS\n\nI work best when I’m part of the whole journey — from the first idea to the final line of code. Whether I’m designing and building from scratch, or bringing an existing design to life with clean, responsive development, I focus on creating digital experiences that just feel right.\n\nI care a lot about the small stuff — the little hovers, transitions, and animations that most people don’t even notice, but definitely feel. Those micro-interactions are what make a site feel smooth, responsive, and alive. I like building things that feel thoughtful, where even the tiniest detail has a purpose.\n\nA fast, accessible site isn’t a bonus — it’s the baseline. I try to make sure what I build loads fast, works on all devices, and feels good for everyone who uses it. Every project’s different. Sometimes I’m more focused on design systems and patterns, other times it's about shipping features fast. I'm comfortable adapting to what the project needs.\n\nLetter Hover Animation\n\n[SEEMYWORK](https://www-nemanjakocovic-com.filesusr.com/html/e9e011_b151d04d0acd8fcf1a1167f845d7fde7.html#)\n\n→\n\nTOUCHING GRASS\n\nWhen I’m not at my desk, you’ll often find me staying active through sports like football, tennis, basketball, or table tennis. Physical activity plays a significant role in my life—it’s not only a way to stay healthy but also a key source of mental clarity and creative inspiration. Whether it’s a challenging workout, a long run, or a simple walk, these moments help me reset and maintain focus.\n\nI also enjoy unwinding with a game of chess or getting lost in a good book. Stepping away from the screen allows me to return with a refreshed perspective and renewed energy.\n\nLET'S CONNECT\n\nDon't be shy — Say hello!\n\nLetter Hover Animation\n\n[EMAIL](https://www-nemanjakocovic-com.filesusr.com/html/e9e011_e0cf516061a0434f9d4d1101f1da1635.html#)\n\nLetter Hover Animation\n\n[INSTAGRAM](https://www-nemanjakocovic-com.filesusr.com/html/e9e011_f4d2d209ecd77b92b3f7a700ba12621a.html#)\n\nLetter Hover Animation\n\n[AWWWARDS](https://www-nemanjakocovic-com.filesusr.com/html/e9e011_16fae9c82b7c0b3440c7108d779b0d4b.html#)\n\nLetter Hover Animation\n\n[DISCORD](https://www-nemanjakocovic-com.filesusr.com/html/e9e011_cde3fe27aafb5204567d63d53b5205ec.html#)\n\nLetter Hover Animation\n\n[EMAIL](mailto:thingbynemanja@gmail.com)\n\n[EMAIL](mailto:thingbynemanja@gmail.com)\n\nLetter Hover Animation\n\n[INSTAGRAM](https://www-nemanjakocovic-com.filesusr.com/html/e9e011_d0f40dddae4f4effd085bab4c15a9510.html#)\n\n[INSTAGRAM](http://instagram.com/thingbynemanja)\n\nLetter Hover Animation\n\n[AWWWARDS](https://www.awwwards.com/thingbynemanja/)\n\n[AWWWARDS](http://awwwards.com/thingbynemanja)\n\nLetter Hover Animation\n\n[DISCORD](https://www-nemanjakocovic-com.filesusr.com/html/e9e011_0ac5acfc5723c5385907b2ff8a563e42.html)\n\n[DISCORD](https://discord.gg/MY5m9SHKjP)\n\nLetter Hover Animation\n\n[DISCORD](https://www-nemanjakocovic-com.filesusr.com/html/e9e011_0ac5acfc5723c5385907b2ff8a563e42.html)\n\n[X](http://x.com/thingbynemanja)\n\nABOUT ME\n\n# Hello, my name is Nemanja Kocovic.\n\n# I'm a Multidisciplinary Digital Designer\n\n# based in Sjenica, Serbia.\n\nLetter Hover Animation\n\n[Getintouch](https://www-nemanjakocovic-com.filesusr.com/html/e9e011_bc7fc46364de5a90d3954cdb3769f648.html#)\n\n(\n\nProjects\n\n)\n\nProjects\n\n(\n\nAbout\n\n)\n\nAbout\n\n(\n\nContact\n\n)\n\nContact\n\n## Dedicated to crafting impactful digital experiences.
